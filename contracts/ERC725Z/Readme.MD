# ERC725Z

ERC725Z is a sub-standard of the proposed ERC725 standard in the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. It is a key-value store that allows attaching arbitrary data to ERC721. The main advantage of using ERC725Y is that it allows for storing any data as needed, even after the smart contract has been deployed. The ERC725Y standard solves the problem of smart contract data being immutable once deployed.


# ERC725Z2

ERC725Z2 is ERC725Z + DataVerify
